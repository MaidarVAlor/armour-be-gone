# Armour, be gone!
### welcome!
made by Mahvay (or "Mva" if you like the shorter word), welcome to this datapack's page.

the "Armour, be gone!" is a datapack that removes specific recipes. mainly armour, but it also affects other recipes.
however, you can still use the removed armor, you will only have to find it in various structures.

### features
well, the first feature is removal of the following recipes:
* Iron armour
* Golden armour
* Diamond armour
* Wooden sword and axe
* Stone sword

the leather armour recipe is changed - it requires strings since you gotta bind the pieces of leather somehow:

since the DP disables diamond armour, smithing it to netherite is impossible so I made a workaround to make it still possible to get the armour - however, it will take **A LONG** time to get the full set:

these recipes in most cases don't make sense, unless you play on a world that doesn't contain trees at all:

### some tips from Mahvay to make this DP work
**A.** to see the pack in action, create a world and try doing following things:
* attempt to make wooden sword or axe...
* ...or a stone sword
* attempt to make leather armor in standard way
* attempt to make golden, iron and diamond armour...
* ...or ignore all the things above and begin a long grind for netherite armour

**B.** to make the game a challenge, create and play on a world with these settings:
* single biome: DESERT (do *NOT* disable structure generation, you will regret it)
* locked difficulty: HARD
* the gamerule `doDaylightCycle` can be only enabled for first 5 Minecraft Days (100 minutes) as a preparation phase, on the midnight of the 5th day (not on transitioning from 4th to 5th day), you MUST disable it as you enter the phase where the actual game starts.

## trivia
1. this datapack was made ~~and tested in 90 minutes, 76 was for the pack and 14 for fixing Windows after updates~~ in 76 minutes.
2. it is around 12 kilobyes big in the disk space.
3. originally, the concept of the pack was to make netherite armor harder to get and remove recipe for iron and diamond armour. but when I looked back to the "Combat Handbook" and saw the fact that "golden items are the easiest to enchant", I also removed the recipe for golden armour.
